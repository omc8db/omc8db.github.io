I'm pretty happy with my UV-5R. It's a cheap ($30) piece of plastic that most people call their first ham radio. It's easy to use, it lasts a long time, it talks to my local repeater. That's everything it needs to do, right?

About a month ago, the amateur radio club started gettting angry emails from local (non-student! yikes!) radio operators. "The D-STAR is down. Fix it." "Aren't you supposed to be providing a public service?". 

After replying "Check you batteries, make sure your volume is turned up." I went to check if there was any truth to their story. But I couldn't. Nobody in the club had a D-Star compatible radio.

# A ray of hope

FreeDV is awesome!
