I'm a software engineer currently working on network software + devops at [Starlink](https://starlink.com/). This is my blog for personal projects. It has no affiliation with my employer.

I graduated from Missouri University of Science and Technology in 2017 with a degree in Computer Engineering. In school I was very involved in our Mars Rover Design team, working on several parts of the rover over the years. I was the autonomy software lead + main programmer in 2017 when we [won the international University Rover Challenge](https://news.mst.edu/2017/06/missouri-st-team-wins-international-mars-rover-competition) with a perfect score in the autonomy section. 

My amateur radio callsign is KE0CFK. I did a few fun projects with it in college, including
* Rebuilding the S&T repeater with my friend W0IAN
* Building a long-range analog video system for the rover project to reduce latency
* RF comms systems on the MR SAT / MRS SAT student design project
